```

OR a custom env variable is available :

```jsx
process.env.TME_PROD === 'SHOW';
```

## Development workflow :

In one terminal, run tsdx watch in parallel:

`yarn start`

In another terminal, run tsdx example:

```jsx
yarn start:app // react -> localhost:1234
// OR
yarn start:vanilla // vanilla -> localhost:1234/vanilla.html
```
